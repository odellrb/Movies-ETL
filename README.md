# Movies-ETL

The goal of this project was to create an automated pipeline that reads new data, performs transformations to clean and condense the data, and loads the data into existing tables. By taking code that was previously created, we refractored it into a function to make cleaner than before. We then loaded our cleaned up table into a PostgresSQL database.
